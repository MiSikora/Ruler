# Ruler

![Ruler](images/ruler_logo.svg){: style="width:400px" }

Distance measurements library for Kotlin and Android.

## TLDR

Define a distance and manipulate it.

```kotlin
// Distance is dimensionless.
val distanceFromMeters: Distance = Distance.ofMeters(100)
val distanceFromYards: Distance = Distance.ofYards(50)

// Length has a unit attached to it.
val metersLength: Length<SiLengthUnit.Meter> = distanceFromMeters.toLength(SiLengthUnit.Meter)
val inchesLength: Length<ImperialLengthUnit.Inch> = distanceFromMeters.toLength(ImperialLengthUnit.Inch)

// metersLength and inchesLength represent the same distance but with a different units attached to them.
check(metersLength - inchesLength == Length.ofMeters(0))
```

Android artifact allows to show a user formatted distances and lengths using appropriate Locale if available.

```kotlin
fun main(context: Context) {
  val distance = Distance.ofMeters(100)
  val length = distance.toLength(Meter)

  // Assumes en_US Locale on a device.

  // Prints "109yd 1ft 1in".
  val humanReadableDistance: String = distance.format()

  // Prints "100.00m".
  val humanReadableLength: String = length.format()
}
```

## Requirements

Ruler requires [Java 8 bytecode](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/java8-support) support. You can enable it with the following configuration in a `build.gradle` file.

```groovy
android {
  compileOptions {
    sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
  }

  kotlinOptions {
    jvmTarget = "1.8"
  }
}
```

## Get Ruler

Ruler is published to [Maven Central Repository](https://search.maven.org/search?q=io.mehow.ruler).

# Ruler

Distance measurements library for Java and Android.

## Integration

Ruler requires Java 8 bytecode. To enable Java 8 desugaring configure it in your Gradle script.

```groovy
android {
  compileOptions {
    sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
  }
  // For Kotlin projects
  kotlinOptions {
    jvmTarget = "1.8"
  }
}
```

To integrate it with your app you need to add a dependency to you project.

```groovy
debugImplementation "io.mehow.ruler:ruler:0.5.3"
```

If you use Android you can use Android artifact.

```groovy
debugImplementation "io.mehow.ruler:android:0.5.3"
```
